Yannis is funded by a studentship from the University of Hull’s Parental Care Research Cluster. Yannis' PhD uses data from BugBase – a large database of insect life history traits compiled from literature and from primary observations.  Yannis is looking at how life history influences, and is influenced by, the evolutionary decision to perform parental care of different forms and by different sexes; and how parental care is associated with economically important traits.
