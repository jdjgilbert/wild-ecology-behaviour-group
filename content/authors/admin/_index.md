I am interested in the evolution of parental care and social behaviour – especially how these crucial animal interactions shape, and are shaped by, animals’ nutritional environments. In the most spectacularly social or parental species (or groups of species), these behaviours are obligatory, which gives little insight into their evolution. Instead my work focuses on evolutionary origins – first using comparative analyses across groups of species that differ in whether they are social or parental; second, using field and lab experiments on species that are behaviourally plastic, i.e. where individuals can choose whether or not to be social or parental. Finally, I am interested in how these factors play out in the wild – and the unforeseen pressures exerted upon parental and social interactions by anthropogenic change.
