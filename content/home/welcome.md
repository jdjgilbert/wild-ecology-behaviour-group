Home page of the WEB group in the Department of Biological and Marine Science at the University of Hull, UK.  We are interested in arthropod ecology and evolution – particularly reproductive strategies and life histories.  We are especially interested in how animals’ nutritional ecology affects (and is affected by) the evolution of sociality and parental care.
