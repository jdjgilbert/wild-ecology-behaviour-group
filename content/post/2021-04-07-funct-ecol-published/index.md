New paper out in Functional Ecology

<!--more-->

Delighted to see that the first paper from Alex’s PhD, _Solitary bee larvae prioritize carbohydrate over protein in parentally provided pollen_, has been published at Functional Ecology, available here: https://t.co/JF7z1PQsev?amp=1. 

We used careful nutritional manipulations to show that mason bee larvae grow best on high carbohydrate diets, and, accordingly, prefer carbohydrate rich diets and “carb-load” when deciding how much to eat. We think this unusual pattern is because, unlike previously studied bees, which were all workers of social species, mason bee larvae have to store fat for overwintering as well as growing and developing, so must make sure they get enough carbohydrate.

Look out for a piece in _The Conversation_ covering this article soon.
